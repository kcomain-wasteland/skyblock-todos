+  check pinned there's a sheet with mithril breakpoints, 
+  you just wanna put enough speed to reach a breakpoint for grey wool if you wanna do comms
+  and then whatever eff miner threshold you can get + the rest into insane tit
!(INSANE TIT)

=numbers in the sheets are mining speed values, attempt to match them
```
(thank you looce)

```
Well for dwarven comms you’ll want to reach certain thresholds of efficient miner: 20/40/60/80
```
